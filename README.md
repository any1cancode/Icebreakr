## What this project does

- This app shows a random fun question

## How it work

- Questions are in questions.json
- Clicking `Next` buttons shows a randomly picked question without delay

## What I like to improve in the future

- Use a different background for a different question
- Find a background image based on question keywords
- Question editor, not using questions.json
